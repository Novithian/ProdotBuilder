----------------------------------
[ ] - Put the gizmo related things in prodot_mesh.rs into prodot_gizmo.rs, which will be attached to 
	another ImmediateGeometry node on the mesh that will have a no depth test material on it.
[x] - ISSUE: Gizmo is no longer relative to position, so it is nowhere near the mesh when the 
	mesh position is changed.
[x] - ISSUE: Gizmo detection is now no longer relative to position.
[ ] - Snapping
[o] - Multi-selection
	[x] - Multple vertices moving at once
	[x] - Deselect
	[o] - ISSUE: The vertices are not maintaining their respective distance.
Face
	[x] - Detect facts in Face mode
	[x] - draw over hovered faces
	[x] - draw over selected faces
	[x] - align gizmo with center of face
	[x] - Detect gizmo hovering
	[ ] - move face's vertices to the updated location
		[ ] - update prodot mesh's array
		[ ] - update mesh
Vertex
	[ ] - Delete Vertex
